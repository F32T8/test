# ABOUT

age:36 | pro:he/him | loc:usa | pol:left | bld:a+

F32T8 is a semi-anonymous journal and a dumping ground for thoughts, lists, and other texts. Broadcasting from a suburb in the heart of America. Started in October 2024. 

This site is (mostly) plain text. There's a tiny bit of HTML/CSS to wrap text, make the line height a little more comfortable, and allow for dark mode. The goal is to keep things as simple as possible.

Also, this site should not be discoverable via search engines and has a robots.txt file that blocks (or discourages) crawlers. The only way anyone should be able to find this site is via a direct link or through the textonly.website webring.

Site credits: Largely inspired by textonly.website (which is maintained by koray.er) and minim.blog specifically. This site is hosted on GitHub Pages for free.

# LISTS

Every Day Items

Wallet: I carry a "minimalist" front-pocket bifold wallet. The brand is HUSKK, but it looks like this model isn't available anymore. It's made of microfiber and is very small and lightweight. I can't imagine ever putting a wallet in my back pocket again. 

Phone: My current phone is a foldable Motorolo Razr 2023. The folding thing is a bit of a gimmick, but it's a gimmick that I love. It makes it more comfortable to carry and adds a tiny bit of friction to mindlessly opening apps.

Keys: Pretty normal keyring setup. The only thing noteworthy is a die cut metal hook that I can use to attach the keys to a bag or belt loop. It's simpler (and less goofy looking) than a carabiner. The only decorative items are the rabies tags from our two previous dogs.

Watch: I usually wear a Casio F-91W. I'm a big fan of this watch. It's lightweight, looks great, and tells the time. But I think I'll switch to a LW204-1B (for the all black aesthetic) once this one dies. 

Contacts: I've been wearing contacts for almost a year now. I don't see myself going back to glasses full time. (But I still wear them in the evenings after showering.)

Sunglasses: One of the big benefits of contacts is that it makes wearing sunglasses much easier. (No more awkwardly swapping between glasses and sunglasses.) And non-prescription sunglasses are much cheaper, obviously. 

Water Bottle: A 32oz Nalgene water bottle. It's covered in stickers and the wear is really starting to show.

# NOTES

Belief is Not a Choice

One of the biggest shifts in the way I think was the realization that belief is not a choice. The word "belief" is used in a variety of ways, which leads to a lot of problems. But the simplest and most common definition is "to accept something as true." (If you define belief in another way, then you are talking about something else.) The "acceptance" is an automatic response. It is a reaction. You are either convinced that something is true or not. 

It's important to point out that you can still be convinced by bad reasons. You also have the ability to choose what claims you are exposed to (to a certain extent) and what reason and evidence you find convincing. Personal agency is still at play up to a certain point. But being convinced of something is not an action that you can take, it is an automatic reaction to the evidence or argument you are encountering.

Which necessitates learning more about what should be convincing and what should not and why. The correct stance is that believing true things is good and believing false things should be avoided. And we should figure out how best to make sure our beliefs match up with reality.

It's also important to point out that beliefs are not necessarily permanent positions. You can bounce between belief and disbelief in an instant, and bounce frequently. How much you believe something can also vary drastically. You can be mildly convinced or extremely convinced. 

This may all seem incredibly obvious, but complications arise when people use the word "belief" to mean things other than "accepting something as true." When discussing belief, people often talk about things that they hope are true rather than what they are actually convinced of. This allows for people to (possibly unintentionally) deceive themselves. 

To speak for myself, I was a religious person for a very long time and held a wide variety of supernatural beliefs. At best, I was convinced of these things for bad reasons. (Such as believing because those around me believed.) And at worst, I did not actually believe these things. Instead, I believed in belief itself. That it was good to believe and that it was something that I should do. 

The word "faith" enters the conversation here and further complicates things. The word is simultaneously used as a reason to believe (in the absence of evidence) and used as a synonym for "hope." Having "faith" in something is often the same as having "hope" that that thing is true. So in believing in belief, I believed (hoped) that I believed. I believed that there were reasons, unseen to me, that would be convincing. That the people who shared my beliefs and were smarter than me must have had the reasons I did not. 

This added layer, of belief in belief, complicates communication and discourages further introspection. Those around me who believed reinforced my belief. Their conviction encouraged my conviction, as iron sharpens iron. However, when discussing our beliefs, we rarely (if ever) analyzed what and why we actually believed. Instead we shared our hopes and wishes and encouraged each other to continue hoping and wishing.

Once I began to better understand that claims should only be found convincing if they are backed up by sufficient evidence or argument, many of my long-held and fundamental beliefs fell away in what felt like an instant.

Listening to Daniel Johnston. Getting sad. Kinda stumbled into it, this time. True love will find you in the end. Thursday night. One of the cats is sitting next to me on the couch. (The fat one.) Blessed. Don't be sad, I know you will. Allowing myself to be distracted. Wasting time. Relaxing? Maybe. Hard to say.

============================

You've reached the very end.
