Listening to Daniel Johnston. Getting sad. Kinda stumbled into it, this time. True love will find you in the end. Thursday night. One of the cats is sitting next to me on the couch. (The fat one.) Blessed. Don't be sad, I know you will. Allowing myself to be distracted. Wasting time. Relaxing? Maybe. Hard to say.

You've reached the very end.
